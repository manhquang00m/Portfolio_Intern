React recommends using the BrowserRouter but that is not going to work with GitHub pages unless you always go in from the main page (index). With HashRouter, a hash symbol is added to the URL, which makes the server ignore what comes after that. The URLs will look something like this now:
http://localhost:3000/#/
http://localhost:3000/#/CanvasTrace
